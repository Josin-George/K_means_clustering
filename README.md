# K-Means Clustering in R
This repository contains an R script for performing k-means clustering on a dataset, given a csv file containing the details of trip details along with finding the optimal value of k using elbow method

## Introduction
K-means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for clustering data points into a predetermined number of clusters. The "k" in k-means refers to the number of clusters that the algorithm aims to partition the data into.

## Requirements

To run the script, you'll need:
- R installed on your machine.
- Basic understanding of R programming and k-means clustering algorithm.
